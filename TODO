* long term feature: templated generic vm
* long term feature: shared_ptr less locator
* long term feature: shared_ptr less resource cache
* custom allocators and EnTT allocator-aware in general (long term feature, I don't actually need it at the moment) - see #22
* scene management (I prefer the concept of spaces, that is a kind of scene anyway)
* debugging tools (#60): the issue online already contains interesting tips on this, look at it
* define basic reactive systems (track entities to which component is attached, track entities from which component is removed, and so on)
* define systems as composable mixins (initializazion, reactive, update, whatever) with flexible auto-detected arguments (registry, views, etc)
* runner proposal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork%E2%80%93join_model https://slide-rs.github.io/specs/03_dispatcher.html
* optimize for empty components, it would be a mid improvement in terms of memory usage (see std::is_empty)
* deep copy of a registry (or use the snapshot stuff to copy components and keep intact ids at least)
* is it possible to iterate all the components assigned to an entity through a common base class?
* can we do more for shared libraries? who knows... see #144
* work stealing job system (see #100)
* composable looper so as to pack erased systems, compose runners at different rates and run them at once in the loop
* meta: sort of meta view based on meta stuff to iterate entities, void * and meta info objects
* meta: move-to-head optimization when searching by name on parts (data, func, etc)
* hashed string: add implicit check on construction for uniqueness (optional)
* signals on entity creation/destruction
* destroy overload that accepts a couple of iterators (see create)
* allow for built-in parallel each if possible
* add on-the-fly sort functionality (is it possible?)
* add support for composable filters
