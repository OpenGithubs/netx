* custom allocators and EnTT allocator-aware in general (long term feature, I don't actually need it at the moment) - see #22
* scene management (I prefer the concept of spaces, that is a kind of scene anyway)
* review doc: separate it in multiple md/dox files, reduce the readme to a minimum and provide users with links to the online documentation on gh-pages
* debugging tools (#60): the issue online already contains interesting tips on this, look at it
* define a macro for the noexcept policy, so as to provide users with an easy way to disable exception handling
* define basic reactive systems (track entities to which component is attached, track entities from which component is removed, and so on)
* blueprint registry - kind of factory to create entitites template for initialization (use signals, it's trivial this way)
* remove Actor::update (it's application dependent), allow tag instead
* AOB
