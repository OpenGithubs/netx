* long term feature: resource cache
* debugging tools (#60): the issue online already contains interesting tips on this, look at it
* work stealing job system (see #100) + mt scheduler based on const awareness for types
* add examples (and credits) from @alanjfs :)

WIP:
* uses-allocator construction: dense set (review), dense map, compressed pair, any (with allocator support), cache, dispatcher, poly, ...
* process scheduler: reviews, use free lists internally
* runtime events (emitter)
* iterator based try_emplace vs try_insert for perf reasons
* registry: remove reference to basic_sparse_set<E>
* dedicated entity storage, in-place O(1) release/destroy for non-orphaned entities, out-of-sync model
* custom allocators all over

WIP:
* resource, forward the id to the loader from the cache and if constexpr the call to load, update doc and describe customization points
* add user data to type_info
* write documentation for custom storages and views!!
* make runtime views use opaque storage and therefore return also elements.
* entity-aware observer, add observer functions aside observer class
* deprecate non-owning groups in favor of owning views and view packs, introduce lazy owning views
* snapshot: support for range-based archives
